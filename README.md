# PowerCo Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for PowerCo, a leading gas and electricity utility provider. The goal is to identify the primary factors contributing to customer churn and provide actionable insights to improve customer retention. The analysis follows a structured data science methodology, encompassing data collection, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, predictive modeling, and visualization.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains raw and processed data files used in the analysis.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model building.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data processing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- **visualizations/**: Generated visualizations and plots.
- **docs/**: Documentation and reports.
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python dependencies required for the project.

## Methodology

1. **Business Understanding & Problem Framing**
   - Define the problem of customer churn and set objectives for the analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Cleaning**
   - Explore the dataset to understand its structure and quality.
   - Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create and enhance features relevant to customer churn prediction.

4. **Modeling and Evaluation**
   - Build and evaluate predictive models using techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
   - Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

5. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Visualize results to uncover trends and patterns.
   - Provide actionable recommendations to PowerCo based on the analysis.
